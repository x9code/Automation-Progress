TestNG(Test Next Generation):
 - it is a unit testing framework tool.
 - used by both Development team to do WBT and Automation Test Engineers to do BBT.
 - It is combination of JUnit + NUnit.
 - It is a 3rd party application, which is downloaded and installed in system.
 
Advantages of using TestNG : 
 In TestNG we can perform
 -  batch execution
 -  Group execution
 -  parallel execution
 -  cross-browser execution
 -  we can generate report for test execution automatically
 -  we can rerun the failed test scripts
 -  listener feature
 -  Assertion
 
Rule for TestNG : 
 1. classes should not created in default package
 2. main() is not used 
 3. System.out.print() is not used instead use Reporter.log("hello world",true);
 
 Points : 
 1. We can give priority and invocation count for a particular test script.
    e.g. @Test (priority = 3, invocationCount = 3)
 2. We can give dependency to a test script based execution of other test scripts
    e.g. @Test (dependsOnMethods = "CreateCustomer")
 3. We can intentionally fail a test script by using Asset class
    e.g. Assert.fail();
 4.
